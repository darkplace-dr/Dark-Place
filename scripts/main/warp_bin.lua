-- Warp Bin
-- god I am so sorry for how shitty this code is

--- The thing you put in the Warp Bin to warp to places \
--- must be 8 characters long and be in upper case
---@alias WarpBinCode string

--- defines the behavior of a Warp Bin code
---@class WarpBinCodeInfo
--- what to do after the code is entered \
--- if a string, treated as a map's id and the player is teleported there \
--- if the last argument is a function, the function is run
---@field result string|fun(cutscene: WorldCutscene)
---@field marker string|nil in case result is a string, the name of the marker you want to teleport the player to

-- I'm going to cause pain and suffering with one weird trick:
-- here's the table containing any and all warp codes for the 
-- warp bin.
-- have fun :]   -Char                 (well its NOT that bad) \
-- to add new codes you'd add new entries of "type" WarpBinCodeInfo to the table below.
-- If you have sumneko's Lua LS you should be able to get nice annonations
---@type table<WarpBinCode, WarpBinCodeInfo>
